This is my discord bot which I created in 2022-23 period. 
Unfortunately I lost all the code which I had used to run this, hence I restarted it recently and I am going to be working on my bot.
P.S. The full code is not given here to avoid Plagirasim.

To get a discord token:
1. Create a discord account
2. Go to the Discord Developer Portal
3. Create a Bot & give it a name
4. Add some description and a profile picture (Optional)
5. On the left side menu open the "Bot" section.
6. Click on "Add Bot" and tehn "Yes, do it!"
7. Under the name of the bot copy the token.
